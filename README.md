goal for 03/29/24: 
    get the game itself working. connect python scripts for top 5 countries of daily letter to 
    the UI. just for countries. 

    refactored directories and folders into proper Flask app format.
    learned how to run Flask server and access webpage through local port.
    still need to figure out how to fetch the array of countries into JS script from Flask app.

04/02: 
    Implemented two RESTful API routes, GET for validating if guesses are even in the pool of guessable
    words (error message pops up in console but next session will have javascript create an html error
    message), and POST for sending guessed word and the daily letter to python server for handling
